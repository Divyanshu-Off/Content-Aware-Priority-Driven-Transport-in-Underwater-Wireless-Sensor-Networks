# Content-Aware Priority-Driven Transport in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **priority-driven packet transmission mechanism** for **Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs)**.  
Unlike terrestrial networks, UWSNs face challenges such as high propagation delay, limited bandwidth, dynamic topology, and high energy consumption.  

Our approach is **content-aware**: packets are prioritized based on their **type, importance, and network conditions**, ensuring critical data (e.g., disaster warnings, navigation signals, or marine monitoring) is transmitted reliably and with reduced latency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement a **content-aware transport protocol** for UWSNs.  
- Prioritize packets based on **urgency, reliability requirements, and data sensitivity**.  
- Optimize **end-to-end delay, throughput, and energy consumption**.  
- Simulate and evaluate performance using **DESSERT (or NS-3)**.  
- Generate a **synthetic dataset** for testing when real-world data is unavailable.
